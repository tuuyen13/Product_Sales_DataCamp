No cleaning is needed.\n\nsale_method: The sales methods actually only have 3 values as the description but turn 5 because they have different writing styles lowercase and acronym. The values should be in consistent format by converting to a proper case to represent 3 sales methods (Email, Email + Call, Call). There are no missing values. \n\ncustomer_id: character value and a unique identifier for the customer without missing values, same as the description. No cleaning is needed.\n\nnb_sold: numeric values, same as the description. No cleaning is needed.\n\nrevenue: numeric values and there were 1074 missing values. The missing values were dropped and all values were rounded to 2 decimal places.\n\nyears_as_customer: numeric values. The company was founded in 1984 so years as the customer cannot be more than 39. Drop 2 values greater than 39 (47, 63).\n\nnb_site_visits: numeric values, same as the description. No cleaning is needed.\n\nstate: character values, same as the description.

Contribution of each method to revevue?\n\n![1](1.png)\n\nImplemented some visualization to state the number of customers for each approach and the revenue contribution of each method. \n\nThe email method was the most popular method to approach customers and sell the new product with 6921 customers so it also contributed more than half of the revenue. One notable insight can be seen the Email+Call method generated 31.4% revenue and surpassed the Call method despite being the least used method.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"b5267961-9788-4cad-b423-51c5830c90d8"},{"source":"## What does the spread of the revenue look like overall?\n\n![2](2.png)\n\nThe chart illustrates the distribution of revenue. In order to observe how sales methods performed last 6 weeks, we can distribute the revenue in intervals of 20 in a histogram.\n\nLooking at the chart, we can see that the majority of revenue value ranged from 40 to 110. The value reaches its peak at  90. The distribution of all of the sales can be described as a normal distribution. It can be seen the majority range of revenue in 40-110 and reach the peak at 90.

Pens and Printers want to use the best techniques to sell the new product effectively, so we should check which method brings more revenue.\n\n\nThe boxplot shows the distribution between 3 sale methods and revenue. It can be seen that the median revenue value of the Email + Call method is the highest (around 183). Besides that, the majority of the revenue of the Email+Call method ranges from 156 to 191, which is also much higher than the Email and Cal method. On the other hand, the call method has the worst performance, majorly from 41 to 53 in range of revenue.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"50dc175f-f123-46da-ace4-95d5dcc59762"},{"source":"## Was there any difference in revenue over time for each of the methods?\n![4](4.png)\n\nThe first chart show that total revenue by sale over 6 weeks. It can be seen that revenue was made through the Email method is highest at the first week. However, it has a tendency to lower in the next weeks and hits rock bottom at the sixth week. In contrast, the Email+Call has a bad start with lowest revenue among 3 methods, but then gradually increased and rose to the top.\n\nThe total revenue is influenced by the number of methods used in a sale. In order to provide a more precise understanding of the effectiveness of each method and allow for better comparisons, we have the second chart showing the average revenue by sale methods over weeks. As you can see, all three methods have an increasing trend in term of average revenue over time. And the Email+Call has the best performance over times.\n\n","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"9e96b86e-f78e-4f09-931f-d69f154bdf85"},{"source":"# Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, Call is the least productive approach among the three methods. It not only required members of the team to be on the phone for around thirty minutes per customer on average but also only contributed to the small revenue. \n\nThe email method initially seemed very effective because it required very little work for the team. However, the declining revenue trend for a long time turns it into not the best choice for the company. \n\nThe Email+Call is the most efficient method for the Pens and Printers company in launching a new product campaign.\nThe combination of first sending the product information email, then calling a week later demonstrated the good and stable performance over time and contributed the most revenue.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"eb08b694-62be-4434-90d8-29f92adbe6ea"},{"source":"# Business Metric\n\nSince our goal is to  use the best techniques to sell the new product effectively. I would recommend we use average revenue by sale methods per weeks as our metric.\n\nBased on our last 6 week data, 31.2% of revenue come from the Email+Call methods. Therefore, if this number is increasing next 6 week, it indicates very good sign to achieve our goal.\n\n","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"3102b81f-1557-4d65-8a20-fcb26710812b"},{"source":"# Recommendation\n\nFor the following weeks, I would recommend we can focus on the following steps:\n\nUsing key metrics to monitor whether there is a strong sign to see the revenue will increase.\n\nFocus on Email+Call Method: Given that the Email+Call method has proven to be the most efficient and productive for launching new product campaigns, consider prioritizing and allocating more resources to this approach. Ensure that your team is trained and equipped to execute this method effectively.\n\nData Collection and Continuous Data Analysi for in-depth analysis: Continue to collect and analyze data regularly to monitor the performance of these methods over time. Market conditions and customer preferences can change, so it's crucial to adapt your strategies accordingly.\n\nFeedback Loop: Establish a feedback loop with your sales and marketing teams. Encourage them to share insights and observations on what is working and what isn't based on customer's feedback. \n\nCustomer Segmentation: Segment your customer base to tailor your approach. Different customer segments may respond differently to the various methods. Customizing your approach for each segment can lead to better results.\n\nCustomer Relationship Management (CRM): Implement a CRM system to better track customer interactions and responses. A well-organized CRM can help in managing and nurturing leads effectively.\n","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"50b4ba66-d6de-448a-b157-a9448a6dcd82"},{"source":"## ‚úÖ When you have finished...\n-  Publish your Workspace using the option on the left\n-  Check the published version of your report:\n\t-  Can you see everything you want us to grade?\n    -  Are all the graphics visible?\n-  Review the grading rubric.
